<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Why should there be a book on tomatoes? The
    world is full of bulletins of experiment stations,
    of articles in periodicals and of general books on
    vegetables which include discussion of tomatoes.</p>
<p>An incomplete set of tomato bulletins includes
    over 350 documents. Many of these are no longer
    available. Many are of no great value but contribute
    this or that small item.</p>
<p>The task of a book like this is to offer between
    two covers, a summary of what seem the most significant
    facts and opinions about the third most
    important vegetable crop in the United States.</p>
<p>The tomato is one of the most rewarding crops
    for the home garden. A little space yields heavily,
    from half a peck to a peck per plant without difficulty.
    It grows well practically everywhere in the
    States, affording high nutritional values whether
    used fresh or canned. And people do like tomatoes,
    whether as salad, cooked vegetable, or
    condiment.</p>
<p>Competition among growers and among districts
    makes three elements necessary for commercial <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> success:&mdash;quality in the goods, economy in
    production, and effectiveness in marketing.</p>
<p>The grower must know his plant, what it is like
    and how it behaves under various conditions and
    treatments. Then, he needs an understanding of
    the economic factors that surround his enterprise.</p>
<p>Conditions in various sections and production
    for various purposes are so diverse that dogmatic
    statement and general advice are precluded. The
    aim is rather by means of available information to
    help the reader to an understanding that will
    enable him to answer his own questions for his
    own conditions and this far better than any broad
    prescription could possibly do. Principles, possible
    practices and examples of field programs are
    offered as guides for self-help for home, school,
    hobby as well as commercial production.</p>
<p>A person who studies on this basis will not be
    thwarted by a sudden shift of weather or market
    but will have at hand the necessary facts and ideas
    to adjust his plan to changed conditions.</p>
<p>No attempt has been made toward complete citation
    of reference. Those given will lead to others

<h2>The Tomato</h2>

<h2>I</h2>
<h2>THE TOMATO IS A GREAT FOOD<br />
    AND CROP PLANT</h2>
<p>Vegetable, Fruit or Berry,&mdash;what is the tomato?
    A standard query this is and many an argument
    has raged about it. The answer is easy. It is all
    three. By culture and use, it is a vegetable; botanically
    it is a fruit and among the fruits, it is a
    berry being indehiscent (non-shedding), pulpy,
    with one or more seeds that are not stones. And
    they say the tomato is more truly a berry than the
    raspberry.</p>
<p>But that doesn't make much difference. The
    thing that matters is that people like the tomato.
    It is easy to grow and nearly every home garden
    has it. It is good to look upon&mdash;shapely, colorful
    and of glossy sheen. A trained single stem plant
    with ripening fruit is a genuine ornament in the
    garden. It is most gratifying to the palate, fresh
    or cooked; soft and grainy, smooth and juicy in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> texture, sweet and tart and with an appealing
    flavor all of its own that few fail to relish. As
    juice or cocktail, adding color and flavor to soup,
    as condiment or as side dish with the entree, as
    salad freshly sliced or in jell, it is welcome with almost
    every course and some ingenious chef or,
    more likely, some clever housewife will, one of
    these days, fashion from it the dessert supreme.</p>
<p>Nor have we exhausted the list of forms in
    which the tomato may be served. In addition to
    its simplest cooked form, stewed or turned hot
    from the can, it may also be baked, stuffed or not,
    or it may be escalloped and cooked with rice, spaghetti
    or other foods. Fried, before fully ripe, and
    served with brown gravy, it is most popular in
    many a home.</p>
<p>Ketchup or catsup is one of our most widely
    used condiments and chili sauce many like even
    better. Green tomato pickles, chow chow, piccalilli
    carry the piquant tang of the tomato to enliven
    the winter table. And tomato juice, plain or
    dressed up with spices, vinegar or lemon juice has
    become a great staple of our groceries, a standard
    send-off for any meal from breakfast snatched on
    the morning sprint to work on through to the
    most elaborate of banquets.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>The tomato, by reason of its natural acidity, is
    readily sterilized and so can be preserved easily in
    glass or tin. It ranks first among the &quot;big three&quot;
    canned vegetables; the other two being sweet corn
    and peas. By far the great bulk that goes to the
    factory is put up with the addition of nothing
    more than salt. In addition to the condiments,
    puree and paste are manufactured in commercial
    quantities. The Italians dry tomatoes extensively
    in the sun, slicing the fruits, and later flavoring
    them to taste for various winter uses.</p>
<p>Though the tomato was not recognized as a valuable
    food until about a century ago, its merit is
    now universally accepted. Bob Adams used to
    call it &quot;the poor man's orange&quot; for it is rich in
    vitamins and in malic and citric acid, possessing
    besides, a fine appetizing flavor which is as truly a
    value in nutrition as it is a pleasure.</p>
<p>Actually, the tomato is mostly water, of rather
    low protein and carbohydrate content but this
    does not detract, for other foods are dependable
    for these staples of nutrition and most of us eat
    too much of them.</p>
<p>The tomato is a youngster among the vegetables.
    In contrast to the onion of Egyptian lore
    and the cucumber reputed to have been used in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> Western Asia many centuries ago, the tomato is
    not reported until the herbalists of the 16th century
    recorded its culture in Italy and England&mdash;but
    with little of the esteem now accorded. The
    name seems to be of Aztec origin and two distinct
    wild forms&mdash;one corresponding to our cherry or
    currant varieties and the other to our larger, flatter,
    less regular fruits of many cells,&mdash;are to be
    found wild in Latin America. Its American origin
    is generally accepted.</p>
<p>Commercially, the tomato is a great crop.
    Among the vegetables, it is outranked only by the
    potato and the sweet potato.</p>
<p>The following table gives a few figures on the
    tomato crop:</p>

<p>Average yield for market is about 116 bushels
    per acre and the average price $1.26 per bushel. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> The government reckons a bushel at 53 pounds,
    or about 38 bushels per ton.</p>
<p>The average cannery yield for 1929-38 was 4.15
    tons; for 1939, 5.58 tons; and 1940, 5.39 tons. This
    shows a material increase. The average cannery
    price for 1929-38 was $12.54 per ton. Yields by
    states varied widely in 1940 from 2.7 tons per acre
    in Arkansas with Indiana at 5.5 to 7.5 in California.
    In northeastern states, it is considered that
    about a seven ton yield is necessary for the farmer
    to break even. In New York, it costs about $60.00
    to grow an acre of tomatoes to first picking. With
    a good yield, picking and delivery costs about
    $3.00 a ton.</p>
<p>Leading market states are Texas, 40,000 acres;
    Florida, 31,000 and California, 22,000. Tomatoes
    are grown in a very large number of states&mdash;23 or
    24 states showing 1,000 acres or more for market.</p>
<p>Leading cannery states are Indiana, 74,000
    acres; California, 52,000; Maryland, 51,000; and
    New Jersey, 33,000. California, also Pennsylvania
    and Ohio have shown recent large gains.</p>
<p>Large quantities grown in town and country
    home gardens are not included in these figures
    and probably also many grown on small scale for
    market.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>After all, however, the United States Department
    of Agriculture estimated per capita consumption
    of fresh tomatoes at 17.7 pounds, about
    one medium sized fruit per week per person. Consumption
    of canned tomatoes is less than a third
    of the fresh consumption. These figures include
    estimates for rural and urban home gardens. So,
    we can hardly be said to be gluttons for tomatoes
    nor even to meet a fair health standard, even considering
    all vegetables together. After all, it does
    not have to be tomatoes even though their high
    nutritional value is <a name="i017" id="i017">recognized</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 438px;"> <img src="images/i017.jpg" width="438" height="800" alt="Figure 1.&mdash;The tomato is the leader among greenhouse
vegetables." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;The
    tomato is the leader among greenhouse vegetables.</span> </div>
<p>In commercial greenhouses, the tomato has replaced
    lettuce as the principal crop and it is likely
    to remain an important under-glass crop until
    such time as the South finds practical means of
    getting it to market with first-class quality&mdash;perhaps,
    harvesting the fruit when it first shows color.</p>
<h3>Solution Culture</h3>
<p>The tomato has been widely used in experiments
    in solution-culture of plants, sometimes
    called &quot;hydroponics.&quot; The method has been in
    use for decades for research purposes, but has been
    widely publicized of recent years as a possible <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> method of commercial culture. A high degree of
    control of factors governing growth is undertaken
    and difficulties are proportionately increased.
    Hence no extensive commercial development has
    occurred. A good presentation of the method has
    been offered by Hoagland and Arnon. <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<h3>The Tomato Plant</h3>
<p>To manage a crop, one must needs know the
    plant. To know the various characters of the tomato
    helps one to master its culture.</p>
<p>The tomato belongs to the night shade family,
    the Solanaceae of the botanist, along with the potato,
    tobacco, petunia, pepper, eggplant, night
    shade, jimson weed and many other plants useful
    and noxious.</p>
<p>The tomato is a warm-season crop, sensitive to
    frost but reasonably resistant to heat and drought,
    thriving under a wide range of climate and soil.
    A frost free season of seventy-five to ninety days
    will mature home garden tomatoes in useful quantities
    if good plants are set but over 120 days are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> needed for economical commercial production.
    Plant growing requires six to eight weeks previous
    to setting out-of-doors. Each fruit requires about
    six weeks from blossom to ripeness. The fruit
    ripens best for yield, color and quality when the
    weather is warm and sunny. Low temperatures
    without frost are not favorable for growth and
    prolonged conditions of this sort may &quot;check&quot; the
    plant and retard the response when higher temperatures
    come.</p>
<p>The tomato is sensitive to extreme day-length,
    setting fruit at 7 to 19 hours but not at 5 or 24
    hours.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p>The tomato responds readily to fertilizers and
    to moisture, coming quickly into vigorous growth
    after unfavorable conditions, unless too badly
    stunted.</p>
<p>As long as moisture and nutrients are available
    and other conditions are favorable, a tomato plant
    will continue to branch and blossom and make
    fruit almost indefinitely. A pruned single stem
    plant in a greenhouse at Cornell once reached a
    length of over 40 feet during a year and a half of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> growth. Thus, it is really a herbaceous perennial
    grown in northern climates as an annual.</p>
<p>The plant branches freely at leaf joints but fruit
    clusters are formed along the bare stem,&mdash;a habit
    not common among plants. Some varieties are
    &quot;determinate&quot; in habit, sometimes miscalled &quot;self-pruning,&quot;
    as branches only attain limited <a name="i020" id="i020">length</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">
    <p style="text-align: justify"> <img src="images/i020.jpg" width="361" height="400" alt="Figure 2.&mdash;The tomato flower. Varieties differ in" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;The tomato flower.
        Varieties differ in protrusion of pistil beyond the stamen column. If style is
        too short, pollination may fail; also, if too long. A long pistil increases
        danger of damage from heat and drying out.</span> </p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>Hot, dry winds often damage floral parts and
    the blossoms drop without setting fruit.</p>
<p>Smith<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has shown that pollen grains germinate
    best at 85&deg; F., almost as well at 70&deg; F., poorly at
    50&deg; F. and very <a name="i021" id="i021">poorly </a>at 100&deg; F.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/i021.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="Figure 3.&mdash;Long section of tomato flower." /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;Long section of
    tomato flower.</span> </div>
<p>The flowers of the tomato are borne in simple
    racemes or, in some varieties, in compound clusters.
    The flowers are normally on the plan of 5
    but cultivated varieties may have six or eight <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> sepals and petals. Sepals are narrow and may be
    as much as an inch long. Petals are united at the
    base. Stamens are united by the anthers surrounding
    the style and stigma. The ovary or little tomato
    is above the calyx but, as it grows, it carries
    corolla and stamens outward until they, with stigma
    and style, drop off. Length of style is a fairly
    important character in its bearing on pollination
    and on susceptibility to heat and wind injury.</p>
<h3>Seedless Fruits</h3>
<p>Recent experiments by several workers have
    demonstrated the possibilities of inducing development
    of fruits without pollination (parthenocarpy)
    by means of certain chemical compounds,
    notably indolebutyric acid, although others are
    effective.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This method yields seedless fruits and
    promises to be of value in insuring a yield of fruits
    under conditions unfavorable for natural setting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>II</h2>
<h2>CHOOSE THE SOIL AND FEED<br />
    THE PLANT</h2>
<p>Almost anywhere that other things will grow,
    the tomato thrives&mdash;so far as soil type is concerned.</p>
<p>Florida grows tomatoes on coral soils that appear
    too poor to produce any useful crop. The
    fields of South Jersey are very sandy but tomatoes
    do well despite costly control of moisture and fertility.
    In some canning sections, clay loams and
    even clay soils are used. The ideal is a medium
    sandy loam, well supplied with humus for good
    water holding capacity. Lighter soils are generally
    earlier. Tomatoes on drouthy soils are likely
    to suffer from blossom end rot as well as from
    poor growth. Good drainage is required. Muck
    or peat soils will grow tomatoes but they are not
    commonly used for commercial production.</p>
<p>Liming is not important for tomatoes even on
    fairly acid soils, assuming, of course, that the very
    small actual calcium requirement of the plant is
    met. This is generally confirmed by experiments
    but it does not preclude the merit of lime in favoring <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> green manure crops which, in turn, make the
    soil more suitable for tomatoes.</p>
<p>The dominant element in most sound tomato
    fertility programs is phosphorus with nitrogen
    second and potash third. Recommendations of
    general application are not possible but each need
    must be met before other beneficial additions can
    be fully effective.</p>
<p>In the home garden, a program that keeps up
    fertility for other crops will suffice for tomatoes.
    In commercial production, especially for canning,
    where prices received are usually low, the program
    must be neatly cut to fit the soil, the crop system,
    the value of the tomatoes and the costs of materials.
    A canning crop in those sections where
    yields are almost bound to be low, will not justify
    heavy investment in fertilizer. Where much is
    spent for irrigation, plant growing, staking and
    pruning, one cannot afford to curtail the fertilizer
    investment that will bring maximum <a name="i025" id="i025">return</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The task of this chapter is not to tell the grower
    how best to provide fertilizer for tomatoes but to
    help him in making his own plan for his own
    need. Research results and practical experience
    both contribute. One may well consult neighbors, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> county agent and extension specialist, as well as
    the many books and bulletins that are available.</p>
<h3>Nitrogen</h3>
<p>Nitrogen is very important to insure the growth
    of vine without which a good crop may not be
    expected. Lands vary more widely in nitrogen
    content than in phosphorus and potash. Sandy
    soils are commonly deficient in this element and
    often difficult to keep supplied. Here liberal applications
    are needed. Up to a hundred pounds <a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of actual nitrogen may prove profitable where
    other conditions justify. Heavier soils, well managed
    and manured during rotation, require less
    nitrogen and fair results may be obtained with no
    fertilizer where investment must be kept to a
    minimum.</p>
<p>Form of nitrogen to be used is largely a matter
    of economy though nitrate for part of it may be
    desirable early in the season when soil is cold and
    nitrification slow. Nitrate is desirable for side <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> dressing but even here ammonia and other forms
    are now considered suitable when the soil is
    warm.</p>
<h3>Failure to Set Fruit</h3>
<p>Why do tomatoes sometimes run to vine with
    failure to set fruit? This is an old, old query and,
    since 1918, has been, directly or indirectly, the
    occasion of more research projects than any other
    horticultural topic. Kraus and Kraybill <a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> set the
    ball a-rolling with a paper which called attention
    first to the observations of Klebs in Germany
    in which he emphasized the fact that external
    conditions influence conditions within the plant
    which in turn influence performance&mdash;a veritable
    chain of causation. Kraus and Kraybill then undertook
    to relate performance (vegetative growth
    and fruitfulness) to internal conditions, chiefly
    carbohydrate and nitrogen content of the plant
    tissues. These, in turn, were traced back to treatments
    applied to the soil.</p>
<p>They suggested four combinations of vegetation
    and fruitfulness in plants as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>1. Non-vegetative and non-fruitful. Plants <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> whose carbohydrate supply has been cut off, say by
        removal of leaves which make carbohydrates.
        These plants were low in carbohydrate and high
        in nitrogen.</p>
    <p>2. Vegetative and non-fruitful. These plants
        were well supplied with both carbohydrates and
        nitrogen. They were of the sort we describe as
        having &quot;run to vine.&quot;</p>
    <p>3. Vegetative and fruitful. These plants were
        well supplied with carbohydrates, but not so liberally
        supplied with nitrogen, thus, providing a
        balance between the two that was favorable for
        a good crop.</p>
    <p>4. Non-vegetative and non-fruitful. These
        plants had ample opportunity for carbohydrate
        making, but were underfed with nitrogen and so
        could not perform well in either vegetation or
        fruit-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kraus and Kraybill conclude that there are
    certain balances between these two groups of compounds&mdash;nitrogenous
    and carbohydrate&mdash;which determine
    the nature of the plant's performance&mdash;whether
    there will be too little vegetative
    growth to permit a crop, whether the plants will
    &quot;run to vine&quot; or whether they will show good
    growth of both foliage and fruit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>From experiments in the same field, using definite
    amounts of nitrate of soda per plant, Work <a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> concluded that while adequate carbohydrate supply
    is necessary for fruiting, excess carbohydrate
    did not, in itself, occasion unfruitfulness but was
    more likely to represent an accumulation of material
    unused by reason of deficiency in some
    other factor&mdash;often nitrogen.</p>
<p>It was shown that nitrate of soda does not injure
    tomatoes until a concentration in the soil is
    attained which is strong enough to plasmolyze the
    cells, that is to withdraw water from them by
    osmosis. Nor were a wide variety of nitrogen and
    moisture and manure treatments sufficient to induce
    the Bonny Best variety to &quot;run to vine.&quot;
    Some varieties are subject to this trouble, mostly
    of the large, late types.</p>
<p>Murneek<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> has shown that the fruitfulness of a
    plant may greatly affect its internal condition, its
    vegetative performance and its later setting of
    fruit. A heavy load of developing fruit, with limited
    soil resources, tends to limit growth and setting.
    Removal of fruit induces renewal of vegetative <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> growth and of fruit setting. Failure to set
    fruit favors vigorous vine growth. This failure
    may be traceable to various causes. (1) To damage
    to floral parts as the blasting of the pistil by heat
    and drouth. Flowers of some varieties show tendency
    toward elongation of pistils with subsequent
    failure to develop normal fruit. Smith and Howlett
    have shown that environmental conditions as
    well as heredity influence this elongation. (2) To
    injury by insects as thrips. (3) To the character
    of the variety used, the Bonny group being very
    slightly susceptible to failure from over feeding
    with nitrogen while some late sorts readily &quot;run
    to vine.&quot; (4) Shortage of nutrient elements as nitrogen
    or phosphorus or others. (5) Lack of adequate
    light or short day. In such cases, there may
    be excess of nitrogen for current need with resultant
    over-development of leafage. Thus, excess
    vegetative growth may be a result as well as a
    cause of poor setting.</p>
<h3>Phosphorus</h3>
<p>Fertilizer experiments fairly generally point to
    the frequency with which phosphorus is the limiting
    factor among nutrients in tomato production. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> MacGillivray<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> has studied the phosphorus content
    of the various parts of the plant, concluding
    that this element is important throughout and not
    alone in seed making or in rapidly growing parts
    as has been believed. Hepler and Kraybill<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> found
    some years ago and others more recently have confirmed
    the influence of liberal phosphorus treatments
    upon <a name="i031" id="i031">earliness</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;"> <img src="images/i031.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Figure 5.&mdash;Effect of omission of phosphorus from complete fertilizer
in Western New York." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 5.</span>&mdash;Effect
    of omission of phosphorus from complete fertilizer in Western New York.</span> </div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<h3>Potash</h3>
<p>The potash requirement of the tomato has not
    been as thoroughly studied as the requirement
    for the other two major elements. It is thought
    that potash has a part in building up sugars into
    more complex carbohydrates.</p>
<p>The consensus of fertilizer experiments suggests
    that potash is less important on most soils than
    phosphorus and nitrogen but that if these elements
    are in good supply, increased yields from
    potash are likely.</p>
<p>Lanham in Texas was unable to find a relation
    between potash fertilization and resistance to
    shipping hazards.</p>
<h3>Stable Manure</h3>
<p>Stable manure has long been recognized as useful
    for tomatoes. It is generally considered better
    to apply it to the preceding crop or at least the
    preceding fall than to use it just before setting of
    plants. If spring application is necessary, it is better
    to use well rotted manure. Stable manure is
    low in phosphorus. An approximate statement
    would be that 10 tons of manure is roughly equivalent <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> to one ton of a 6-3-6 fertilizer. Thus, 1,000
    pounds of 18% superphosphate would bring the
    analysis to 6-12-6 which would be generally regarded
    as a good balance.</p>
<p>A recent publication<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> from Pennsylvania emphasizes
    the value of manures and of phosphorus.</p>
<h3>Placement and Side Dressing</h3>
<p>Recent experiments have shown the desirability
    of placing fertilizer close to but not in contact
    with the roots of the young plants. When newly
    set and before new roots have developed is the
    time when nutrient material close at hand is
    needed to give the plant a vigorous send-off.
    Transplanters have been devised with attachments
    to place the fertilizer in bands at each side
    of the row of tomatoes and about two inches deep.</p>
<p>Recent experiments, notably by Sayre<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of New
    York, have shown the advantage of dissolving fertilizer
    materials in the water used for transplanting
    tomatoes. One combination of materials
    consists of ammo-phos, 14-48, 2 parts and potassium <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> nitrate, 1 part. Five to eight pounds of this
    mixture are dissolved in 50 gallons of water and
    about &frac14; pint or &frac12; cup is applied to each plant,
    usually by the transplanting machine. There are
    other suitable mixtures of nutrients for this purpose.
    A very small investment in starter solutions
    has shown material increase in total yield. The
    practice places immediately available nutrients in
    the soil at the time and place to be of maximum
    usefulness to plants that have been severely root-pruned
    and have not yet had opportunity to rebuild
    the root <a name="i034" id="i034">system</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;"> <img src="images/i034.jpg" width="800" height="571" alt="

    side-dressing tomatoes.</span> </div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>Another critical stage in tomato growth comes
    when much fruit has been set in the clusters and
    demands upon plant and soil are especially heavy.
    At this stage, side dressing with nitrogen is helpful
    in maintaining plant growth and providing
    resources for growth and maturing of fruit. On
    sandy or nutrient-deficient soils, more than one
    side dressing may be advisable. Sodium nitrate
    is commonly used but other materials are suitable
    after the soil has warmed up. Side dressing with
    fertilizer in solution has been recommended recently
    by Tiedjens of New Jersey.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h2>THE BEST IN SEED IS NONE<br />
    TOO GOOD</h2>
<p>A tomato crop may be much poorer than the
    seed from which it grows but it can be no better.</p>
<p>The tomato seed is short-oval and flattened in
    shape, covered thickly with short silky hairs. The
    embryo or baby plant is coiled in a spiral and imbedded
    in the endosperm (reserve food supply).
    Three or four years is generally given as the life
    of the seed but it often remains viable much
    longer&mdash;up to 10 or 12 years in extreme cases.
    Good seed should germinate 85% to 90%.</p>
<p>Tomato seed sprouts readily, requiring fairly
    warm temperature, say, 70&deg; to 75&deg; F. for best results.
    It germinates very slowly at 40&deg; to 50&deg; F.</p>
<h3>Breeding</h3>
<p>Being a major vegetable crop, the tomato has
    received much attention from plant breeders.
    Objectives sought include good cannery type, resistance
    to the fusarium wilt and other diseases, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> better greenhouse forms, improved general market
    and home garden sorts, and varieties adapted
    for arduous conditions such as hot and dry summers
    or very short growing seasons.</p>
<p>The tomato is largely but not wholly self pollinated
    and pollen is not carried far. Thus, it is
    not difficult to breed to practically a pure-line
    condition.</p>
<p>Tomatoes for seed are usually ground up and
    the seed and fine pulp are separated from the
    skins and coarse material by screening. The juice,
    fine pulp and seeds are allowed to ferment from
    24 to 48 hours, or until the jelly-like pulp is readily
    washed away. After washing, the seed is dried
    in thin layers and stored. A bushel of tomatoes
    may be expected to yield 2&frac12; to 4 ounces of seed
    and an acre of tomatoes, from 100 to 225 pounds.
    These vary greatly according to varieties and conditions.</p>
<p>Wellington<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and others have shown that first
    generation seed from crosses of suitable varieties
    show a marked increase of vigor (heterosis or hybrid
    vigor) over either parent or over the later
    generations. This fact would seem to offer possibilities <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> in practical use, but it has not thus far
    proved of value.</p>
<h3>Selection Methods</h3>
<p>Many growers find it profitable to save their
    own tomato seed. The plant is an annual, the
    important characters are quite readily observed
    and natural crossing is not serious. For these reasons,
    the enterprise is not as difficult as with most
    vegetables, although, if done well, it makes heavy
    demands in labor and care at a time when the
    grower has much else to do.</p>
<p>The first step in selection is to establish clearly
    the ideal to be sought, recording it in detail on
    paper for future reference. Selections should be
    made on the basis of the plant, not of the individual
    fruit. It is the plant that is reproduced and
    the seed from &quot;crown clusters&quot; is no earlier than
    seed from later settings. The field should be
    searched soon after blooming time and plants that
    appear promising should be marked. These plants
    should be examined three or four times as the
    season advances, and markers pulled from plants
    that do not measure up to the desired standard.
    Suppose ten plants remain; all fruits from each of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> these may be saved, keeping the seed of each plant
    separate. All or part of the seed may be planted
    in separate rows the next year for further selection
    and to note which parents best transmit their
    excellent points. If only a small amount of seed
    is required, direct selections may be made for use
    in planting for the general crop. If a larger
    amount of seed is required, seed from one or two
    of the best plants should be planted in multiplication
    plats. Off-type plants should be removed
    from such plantings, but otherwise all the seed
    may be saved for use. Repeated selection results
    in constant improvement until the stock becomes
    a &quot;pure line&quot; or practically so.</p>
<p>Lindstrom of Iowa has led in research on the
    genetics of tomatoes, chromosome relations and
    mode of inheritance. Many scientific papers deal
    with inheritance methods and results. The Yearbook
    of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.) for 1937 contains
    a valuable chapter on tomato breeding. It
    may also be had as Yearbook Separate 1581.</p>
<h3>Certification</h3>
<p>As with certain other kinds of seeds, certification
    service for tomatoes has now been set up in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> several states. Certification is a most useful incentive
    toward care in breeding and handling and
    affords valuable assurance to the buyer. It is necessary
    to know just what is guaranteed by the certificate.
    It is at the same time wise to be informed
    as to the inclusiveness and methods of the certification.</p>
<h3>The Ideal Variety</h3>
<p>In breeding for better varieties of tomatoes, the
    following are some of the characters to be sought:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>(1) A vigorous vine which is necessary to produce
        abundant fruit and to protect from
        sunscald.</p>
    <p>(2) Resistance to disease especially to fusarium.</p>
    <p>(3) High productiveness with moderate number
        of fruits per cluster&mdash;say, <a name="i041" id="i041">5 to 8</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

    Jewel. 3, 7, 11. Stone. 4, 8. Earliana. 12. Ponderosa.</span> </div>
<blockquote>
    <p>(4) Evenness of maturity. This is somewhat
        out of line with the nature of the tomato
        but much could be accomplished toward
        the goal of varieties that make their crop
        and are gone, eliminating long picking periods
        and the drag of inferior fruit toward
        the end of the season. The so-called determinate <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> habit of some varieties such as
        Pritchard is a step in this direction.</p>
    <p>(5) Size suitable for expected use and for market
        demand. Greenhouse tomatoes are
        generally smaller than those for cannery.
        Uniformity of size is increasingly important
        with wide-spread use of the lug-box pack
        and of small consumer cartons.</p>
    <p>(6) Globular to oblong shape is desirable for
        market but is less important for cannery.
        Form should be symmetrical, even and
        smooth.</p>
    <p>(7) Color should be deep and rich, fully and
        evenly developed, inside and out. Red is
        generally preferred to pink. The difference
        between red and pink tomatoes does not
        reside in the flesh but in the presence of
        yellow pigment in the skin of the former
        while the skin of the latter is without pigment.
        Yellow tomatoes are also <a name="i043" id="i043">extan</a>t.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(8) Skin should be thick and tough. This safeguards
        against damage on the way to market
        and favors ease of peeling. Those saladists
        who serve sliced tomatoes with skins
        unremoved, may call for a thin, tender <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> skin but this practice finds no encouragement
        from discriminating partakers.</p>
    <p>(9) Flesh should be abundant in thick walls
        with a minimum of watery pulp surrounding
        seeds. In general, a structure of many
        small cells is desirable.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<p><i>Earliana.</i>&mdash;The earliness of this old and popular
    variety outweighs its demerits where this character
    is required. The past ten years have seen
    material improvement.</p>
<p>Earliana is early, of small vine, with small
    leaves and leaflets. Clusters are compoundly
    branched, with many fruits. The fruits are of medium
    size, deep oblate, cross section often elliptical
    rather than circular. There are many rough
    irregular fruits, varying in this respect with breeding
    and conditions of growth. Color is red, not
    too deep and tending to be poorly developed at
    the stem end. Interior consists of many small cells
    with thin walls.</p>
<p><i>Bison.</i>&mdash;represents a group of varieties bred for
    rigorous climates of our most northerly states. A.
    F. Yeager formerly of North Dakota, later of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> Michigan, now of New Hampshire has led in this
    development.</p>
<p><i>Victor.</i>&mdash;is a new variety bred originally by
    Yeager but introduced by K. C. Barrons of Michigan.
    It affords smoother, deeper and better colored
    fruits about as early as Earliana. It is determinate
    in habit and shy in foliage, increasing
    danger of sunscald. Rich soil and ample moisture
    are needed for its best development. <i>Bounty</i> and <i>Home Garden</i> are similar.</p>
<p><i>Penn State.</i>&mdash;Penn State, developed by C. E.
    Myers of Pennsylvania, is not as early as Earliana.
    It is similar in fruit characters though distinctly
    better in color and shape. It is marked by short
    branches (determinate habit) and is designed to
    give an early crop to be followed by prompt abandonment
    of the planting. It is not to be confused
    with Penn State Earliana.</p>
<p><i>Bonny Group.</i>&mdash;This group embraces our leading
    second early varieties widely used for home
    garden, greenhouse, market and cannery in the
    north. It includes <i>Bonny Best</i>, <i>John Baer</i> and <i>Chalk Jewel</i> with many additional names and
    with much confusion of characters among them.</p>
<p>Bonny Best is second early and of medium plant
    growth. Fruits are deep oblate to flattened globe, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> even and smooth, of good red color, with few
    large, thick-walled cells.</p>
<p>Varieties and strains of this group vary in
    growth and yield, in size, shape and earliness of
    fruit and in suitability for greenhouse, market,
    cannery and juice. <i>Stokesdale</i> and <i>Scarlet Dawn</i> are meritorious newer names in the <a name="i046" id="i046">group</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;"> <img src="images/i046.jpg" width="800" height="523" alt="Figure 9.&mdash;Marglobe plant." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 9.</span>&mdash;Marglobe plant.</span> </div>
<p><i>Marglobe.</i>&mdash;This variety was developed by the
    late Dr. F. J. Pritchard from a cross between Marvel,
    a French variety lending resistance to fusarium
    and Globe, an old variety of fine size and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> shape. It is widely used, north and south, for
    market&mdash;green or ripe, for cannery and to some
    extent, for <a name="i047" id="i047">forcing</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img src="images/i047.jpg" width="600" height="508" alt="Figure 10.&mdash;Marglobe fruit." /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 10.</span>&mdash;Marglobe fruit.</span> </div>
<p>Marglobe is a midseason variety, with large vine
    and foliage, resistant to fusarium and nailhead
    spot. Fruits are nearly globular, shapely and
    smooth, medium to large, scarlet red, with medium
    number of thick walled cells. Marglobe is
    rather subject to deep radial cracks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Pritchard</i> is of the general type of Marglobe
    but is earlier, with short branching habit and resistance
    to nailhead rust and to fusarium, and, perhaps,
    is less subject to cracking.</p>
<p><i>Greater Baltimore</i> is used chiefly for canning in
    long-season districts. It is late, with large vine,
    large flat fruits of excellent scarlet red, outside
    and in, with many thick walled cells. <i>Indiana
    Baltimore</i> is a variant widely grown in the mid-west
    for cannery.</p>
<p><i>Rutgers</i> was developed by L. G. Schermerhorn
    at the New Jersey Experiment Station for fine
    juice and canning characters&mdash;color, flavor and
    substance. Growth is vigorous and yields are
    heavy; fruits are large, flattened and well colored.</p>
<p><i>Gulf State Market</i> is a second early shipping
    tomato, generally harvested green. It is flattened
    in shape, of well developed pink color and good
    interior.</p>
<p><i>Comet Group.</i>&mdash;These trace mostly to English
    or other European origin and are increasingly
    used for greenhouse and for staking out-of-doors.
    Comet is small, flattened, slightly corrugated
    about the stem, of fine even red color, very firm
    and solid, with few very thick walled cells.
    Other names are <i>Sunrise</i>, and <i>Lord Roberts</i>. Several <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> American forcing strains have been developed
    with at least one parent of this group&mdash;<i>Ideal</i>, <i>Grand Rapids Forcing</i>, <i>Field Station Comet</i>, <i>Trellis</i>, <i>Michigan State Forcing</i>, <i>Lloyd Forcing</i>, <i>Blair
    Forcing</i> and others.</p>
<p><i>King Humbert</i> and <i>San Marzano</i> represent the
    small Italian oblong tomatoes that are prized for
    their thick walls, fine color and suitability for
    puree, paste and soup.</p>
<p><i>Ponderosa</i> is popular for home garden, a &quot;beef-steak&quot;
    tomato of very large size, irregular shape,
    flat, pink, with many small cells and of very mild
    sub-acid flavor. It is best grown to single stem. <i>Oxheart</i> is large, heart shaped, pink and very
    meaty. Others of this general type may be had in
    red, yellow and orange flesh. In general, the
    whole group lacks in prolificacy.</p>
<p><i>Oddities.</i>&mdash;Tomato fanciers often plant seed of
    Red and Yellow Pear, Cherry, Currant, Peach
    with its fuzzy skin, Plum and others. They are
    prized for preserves and for decoration. Ground
    Cherry or Husk Tomato is not a true tomato but
    belongs to a different genus (Physalis). It makes
    excellent preserves. Well do I remember sneaking
    off from the other kids for solitary plunder of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> the little row that was usually in Grandma's
    garden.</p>
<p>Comprehensive descriptions of leading varieties
    of tomatoes have been published by the United
    States Department of Agriculture in Miscellaneous
    Publication 160, the result of statistical and
    verbal notations over several years at five widely
    scattered stations of the country.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h2>STRONG PLANTS FOR EARLY<br />
    MATURITY AND HEAVY<br />
    CROP</h2>
<p>One of the ways to make money from tomatoes
    is to mature them early, selling while the price is
    still high. There is a big difference between $.10
    a pound and $.10 a basket. Shipped and ripened
    green wrap tomatoes cannot be very cheap on
    northern markets even though Southern growers
    may realize little for them.</p>
<p>Another way to profit is to grow good plants to
    sell. Judging by the spindling, crowded, soft or
    over-hardened plants so common in stores, there
    should be great opportunity here and, as a matter
    of fact, many market gardeners do well in this
    business realizing welcome returns when other income
    is negligible.</p>
<p>To market ten-cent-a-pound tomatoes from out-doors
    requires good plants&mdash;plants that have
    passed through their youth nearly or fully up to
    blossoming time with benefit of heat and shelter
    and that are ready to keep up vigorous growth in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> face of the demands of fruiting. A few scattering
    fruits matured early do not suffice.</p>
<p>Even for cannery, good plants are required. In
    most regions, plants are not as good as they should
    be. All too often, outdoor seed bed plants are set
    where cold frame or at least cloth cover should be
    employed. Further north, cold frame plants or
    second run or other inferior plants are used instead
    of the best. That is why many canning companies
    have greenhouses and grow plants for their
    farmers.</p>
<p>And in the home garden, the quality of vine
    ripened fruit along with the satisfaction of early
    maturity are goals worth striving for.</p>
<p>Plant growing is a game of skill. It calls for keen
    observation, constant and faithful attention to
    small details, and a high order of workmanship in
    the various operations. Furthermore, when a considerable
    number of plants are to be grown, it
    calls for good organization and rapid work if costs
    are not to be unduly increased. A transplanter
    who makes three motions where two will suffice is
    likely to turn profit into loss, for the loss of a second
    when repeated thousands of times makes
    many hours.</p>
<p>The grower who is producing tomatoes for first-early <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> maturity wants a plant that will withstand
    the rigors of transplanting and of inclement
    weather which may follow, that will start immediately
    into growth, and that will mature fruit in
    good quantity at the earliest possible date. This
    usually means a plant about ten inches tall, with
    heavy, firm, dark-colored stem (though not over-hardened),
    a heavy body of dark, healthy foliage,
    and a cluster of blossoms, with possibly a fruit or
    two already set. If the buds in the axils of the
    leaves have begun growth, no harm will be done.</p>
<p>Many growers are doubtful whether it is well to
    have fruit set on plants when they are transplanted
    in the field, as they claim that the little tomatoes
    are often lost and in any case the progress of the
    plant is retarded. Such plants must be handled
    with great skill. If they are severely checked when
    taken to the field, other and less advanced plants
    may do as well. There is danger in having plants
    too far advanced, and an unexpected delay in field
    setting may result in spindling and over-hardening
    that may prove disastrous. A vigorous and
    properly hardened plant that is younger will do
    better under such circumstances. Some growers
    protect themselves by having plants of more than
    one sort.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h3>Open-bed Plant Growing</h3>
<p>With favorable conditions and careful methods,
    good plants can be grown in open beds but they
    must be grown and used where the season is long
    or be grown in the south and shipped north.</p>
<p>Soil should be free of disease and nematodes, of
    good physical character, full of humus and nutrients.</p>
<p>Seed may be sowed a week or two after &quot;average
    date of last killing frost&quot; which may be learned
    from county agent or weather bureau. Further
    south planting times are gauged by the time tomatoes
    are to be set and by experience as to safe
    or reasonably safe sowing dates. Rows are usually
    a foot apart, more or less. Good plants call for
    sowing thinly, 6 to 12 seeds per foot, but several
    seeds per inch are not unusual. One may expect a
    million plants per acre with close planting or
    40,000 plants per pound of seed.</p>
<h3>Southern Plants</h3>
<p>Many millions of tomato plants are grown in
    open fields in the south to be sent to home gardeners
    in small parcels on seedsmen's orders, to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> sold to commercial growers or to be delivered on
    contract to canners.</p>
<p>A suitable climate and soil, good seed, freedom
    from disease and insects and good handling and
    packing are all required for satisfactory results. In
    far too many cases, these requirements have been
    sadly neglected and a good deal of distrust has
    been engendered. Here, as in buying seed, one
    must discriminate among good and poor growers.
    Canners who order in millions can send men south
    to investigate and supervise with good results.</p>
<p>Georgia now has a certification service for plants
    that helps greatly to build up and maintain high
    standards.</p>
<h3>Growing Early Plants in the North</h3>
<p>Varied programs of plant growing are in vogue
    in the temperate and cooler regions. A simple cold
    frame with or without transplanting may be employed.
    Seedlings may be started in hotbed or
    greenhouse and then transplanted to cold frames
    to finish the job. Some sow seed early, transplant
    once in the greenhouse at 1&frac12; or 2 inches each
    way and then again to cold frame with wide spacing
    say, 4 &times; 4 inches or using pots or dirt bands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>For this method, as much as twelve weeks may be
    allowed but if space permits, excellent results may
    be achieved in seven or eight weeks transplanting
    but once to pots or to 4 &times; 4 inches in <a name="i056" id="i056">flat or bed</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;"> <img src="images/i056.jpg" width="800" height="424" alt="Figure 11.&mdash;A good small greenhouse for plant growing." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 11.</span>&mdash;A good small
    greenhouse for plant growing.</span> </div>
<h3>The Place to Grow Plants</h3>
<p>For northern climates, greenhouses are practically
    required. Canneries or other large growers,
    have wide houses similar to those used for winter
    maturing crops. A market gardener may have a
    little house of 10&acute; &times; 20&acute; to 20&acute; &times; 60&acute; or larger as
    needed. If one does not object to some inconvenience
    and discomfort, a hotbed may be used&mdash;heated
    with hot water or electricity, or as in years <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> past, with fermenting manure. Cold frames may
    be covered with glass sash as in the case of hotbeds,
    or cloth may be used. There are also materials
    consisting of wire cloth filled with cellulose film.
    Special mats of straw or of quilted burlap may be
    used for extra cover and large growers often employ
    coarse manure, straw or marsh hay.</p>
<p>Many a tomato gets its start in life in a small flat
    in a kitchen window&mdash;perhaps, in a cigar box.
    Such seedlings may then be carried forward in hot
    bed or cold frame.</p>
<h3>Beds, Flats and Pots</h3>
<p>Growing plants directly in ground beds in the
    greenhouse and directly in the soil in the hotbeds
    or cold frames, is rather common. However, the
    use of flats or plant boxes in plant growing offers
    a number of advantages as compared with planting
    in the bed. Transplanting can be done at
    benches under conditions of comfort and convenience
    which make for efficiency. Moisture can be
    more precisely controlled and flats can be shifted
    if some plants grow faster than others. Plants can
    be moved with more dirt on the roots, and this is
    a great advantage when plants are sold and hauled <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> some distance, though, of course, pulled plants are
    handled more cheaply. On the other hand, the
    first cost, and the maintenance and storage of the
    flats must be considered. Flats may be set on the
    ground in the greenhouse without use of benches.</p>
<p>Flats are of many dimensions, ordinarily six to
    ten per sash or about 18 &times; 22 inches or 13 &times; 18
    inches outside measure. They may be made of
    lumber from used boxes, but they ought to be
    uniform in size and made to fit beds without loss
    of space. The more durable kinds of wood, cypress
    or chestnut are preferred. Some growers
    make the bottoms of the flats of square-mesh galvanized
    screen (hardware cloth), about five or six
    meshes to the inch. This allows roots to penetrate
    the soil of the beds, permits root pruning by shifting,
    and there is no wooden bottom to rot.</p>
<p>Some growers use clay pots for plants which are
    receiving special care. Their cost is an obstacle
    though they are used repeatedly. Such pots also
    hold less soil for the area occupied than flats or
    square <a name="i059" id="i059">dirt bands</a>.</p>

    for the early crop. 1. Shows plants in paper bands of excellent proportion and
    thrift but not yet in bloom. 2. In blossom but fruit has not yet set. 3. Similar
    to 2 but a little further advanced and has actually set fruit.</span> </div>
<p>Paper pots are used to some extent. Organisms
    decomposing the paper may use and so render unavailable
    some of the nitrogen of the soil thus
    hindering the growth of the plants. This may be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> corrected by seeing that abundant nitrogen is present
    in the soil either when made up or by later
    application of nitrate sowed upon the soil while
    plants are dry or applied in solution in watering.</p>
<p>Dirt bands of veneer are used and are very satisfactory.
    Blocking as practiced by many growers is
    a cheap and effective way of attaining much the
    same results.</p>
<h3>The Blocking System</h3>
<p>When the cold frame is prepared for the last
    transplanting, two inches of fairly well-rotted manure
    is laid down and two or three inches of prepared
    soil is placed on top. Plants are set about
    four inches apart each way. About a week before
    field setting, a butcher knife, or a hoe which has
    been straightened and sharpened, is run between
    rows both ways. This cuts the roots whereupon
    the plant at once begins to form new feeders
    within the block thus reducing, to some extent at
    least, the damage which might be caused by transplanting.
    The method is also used with flats.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<p>Soil for plant growing should be free of disease
    and nematodes, friable, not readily forming a
    crust, receiving and retaining moisture well, but
    drying off quickly on the surface after watering
    and well supplied with nutrients. A sandy loam
    base with good humus content is desirable. It may
    be prepared, beginning a year or two ahead by
    growing and plowing under well fertilized green
    manure crops. Or a compost heap may be prepared
    with successive layers of soil and manure or
    other humus making material. In either case, it is
    usually mixed a time or two by shoveling over or
    by passing through a shredding machine or a
    coarse screen.</p>
<p>If trouble is likely to be experienced from
    damping-off fungi, the soil may be heated to
    200&deg; F. and held there for an hour, using oven or
    electric or steam sterilizer. Seed may also be
    treated with red copper oxid or semesan.</p>
<h3>Seed and Seed Sowing</h3>
<p>Tomato seed runs about 125,000 to 150,000 per
    pound. An ounce of seed is usually depended <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> upon for plants for an acre. For growing seedlings,
    seed may be sowed up to 100 or more per foot of
    row. For a maximum number of strong seedlings
    from a small amount of seed, thinner sowing is
    desirable. Rows are usually about two inches
    apart, and a quarter of an inch is sufficient cover.
    The seedlings break ground in a week or <a name="i064" id="i064">ten days</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 256px;"> <img src="images/i064.jpg" width="256"
 height="400" alt="Figure 13.&mdash;Tin can" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 13.</span>&mdash;Tin can prepared for
    sowing tomato seed.</span> </div>
<p>Uniformity of depth of rows and of covering is
    important. Otherwise, seedlings will come up
    unevenly and there will be considerable waste.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<h3>Care of Seedlings</h3>
<p>Water and heat should be provided to permit
    a steady and moderate rate of growth in plants.
    Over-watering and high temperature yield soft
    and spindling plants and also plants that are overgrown
    and that are liable to severe checking before
    field setting. Under-watering and low temperature
    give stunted plants. The thermometer at the
    earlier stages of growth may well stand around 70
    to 75 degrees by day and 10 degrees lower at night.
    A reasonable range of temperature and moisture
    gives opportunity for the skillful grower to forward
    or retard his plants as seems best. Great care
    should be exercised to water evenly. It is necessary
    to watch the plants constantly to detect the
    slightest variations in growth. The watering may
    then be modified and even progress insured.</p>
<p>Ventilation finds its chief significance as a means
    of controlling temperature and humidity, though
    actual change of air may be a factor.</p>
<p>High soil moisture, high humidity, high temperature,
    and faulty ventilation, all favor the ravages
    of the various damping-off fungi mentioned
    above which cause little plants to rot off near the
    ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<h3>Transplanting</h3>
<p>The main advantage of transplanting plants before
    they are set in the field is to give them increased
    space, or, in other words, to conserve space
    in greenhouses and frames. Other advantages have
    been claimed, but in many instances the gains have
    resulted from more space rather than from the
    actual shift. Transplanting checks growth through
    breakage and disturbance of the root system.
    Loomis<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> finds that &quot;the immediate effect of transplanting
    is a reduction in the water supply, and
    the immediate and long-time results are dependent
    upon the severity and duration of such reduction.&quot;
    Transplanting has little effect upon very
    young plants and a shift at the age of six or eight
    weeks checks the plant about as much as two earlier
    transplantings. The tomato falls in the group
    of plants that stand transplanting well, roots being
    rapidly replaced. Transplanting breaks roots and
    so results in the growth of branches which are
    shorter than the members of the old system. The
    new system is accordingly less severely damaged in
    later transplantings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>To insure efficiency, the work of transplanting
    merits careful attention. Carelessness as to details
    means loss through unevenness of plants. For example,
    if soil is not carefully packed at the edges
    and corners of the flats, irregular water supply and
    irregular growth result. If much transplanting is
    to be done, it pays to divide up the work, as is
    done in a factory. Have a good place for doing
    the work&mdash;a warm, light, and comfortable room.
    Tired workers are not efficient. Spotting boards
    are of service if properly made and correctly used.
    Soil should always contain just the right degree of
    moisture to allow holes to stand open. Care must
    be taken that the workers in setting plants do not
    double the roots or close the holes at the top leaving
    the roots dangling in an open space below.</p>
<p>It is said that a good worker will prick out
    10,000 plants per day, though everything must be
    convenient to accomplish this and many growers
    regard 6,000 plants as a good day's work.</p>
<h3>Pruning Young Plants</h3>
<p>Pruning of tops injures rather than helps the
    plant, for it destroys leaves which are the machines
    that make carbohydrates, the principal material <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> for growth. Pruning to cure legginess is bad.
    Proper management of time, temperature and water
    will provide adequate control and if plants
    should become leggy, it is better to plant them by
    laying them down in a trench with a few inches
    of top above ground than it is to prune them.</p>
<p>Nipping out the growing point with the first
    cluster of flower buds is sometimes practiced to
    encourage branching and a heavier yield of early
    fruit. If this is done, ample space and nutrients
    must accompany careful management. Otherwise,
    the plant finds itself with inadequate resources to
    do a big job.</p>
<h3>Hardening</h3>
<p>Tomato plants cannot be made frost proof, but
    low temperature, reduced moisture supply, partial
    starvation, and crowding all tend to make plants
    more resistant to cold, to drying winds, to heat, to
    mechanical injury such as breakage of leaves and
    stems, and even to cut-worm attacks. Plants can
    be hardened appreciably in a short time&mdash;say a
    week. It is now generally accepted that moisture
    control is more useful than reduced temperature
    as a means of hardening. Starving and crowding
    are not desirable methods. Plants can be kept on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> the dry side if glass or other water-shedding cover
    is available.</p>
<p>Great care must be exercised to avoid over-hardening
    of tomato plants, for in this way a check
    in growth is incurred from which they recover
    slowly, and perhaps never fully.</p>
<p>Much study has been given to the changes in
    plants which underlie the hardening process, and
    papers by Harvey, Rosa, Loomis, and others
    should be consulted in this <a name="i067" id="i067">connection.</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/i067.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="Figure 14.&mdash;Plants that have been crowded and overgrown," /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 14.</span>&mdash;Plants
    that have been crowded and overgrown, probably undernourished and over-hardened.
    Plants like this are very often set in the field. They are definitely slow in
    starting growth.</span> </div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>Watts<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> has shown that adverse conditions, especially
    low temperature and water deficiency prevailing
    at the time when fruit clusters are barely
    beginning to form, commonly occasion the development
    of misshapen fruits.</p>
<p>Faithful spraying or dusting with Bordeaux in
    the plant bed has proved a useful means of forestalling
    destructive leaf blights which often devastate
    whole fields.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>V</h2>
<h2>GOOD CULTURE FAVORS<br />
    GOOD RETURNS</h2>
<p>The tomato is not especially exacting as to care
    after it has been set out-of-doors. It will do business
    if given half a chance. At the same time,
    much can be done to favor earliness, good yield
    and high quality.</p>
<h3>Time of Planting</h3>
<p>In general, tomatoes are set in field or garden as
    soon as danger of frost is reasonably past. Suppose
    May 1st is average date of last killing frost. Growers
    would make general plantings from May 18th
    to 25th though, in rare instances, frost might occur
    as late as May 28th or 30th. The last week of
    May is planting time over a vast area of the North.
    Venturesome souls will set home garden plants as
    early as May 10th, standing ready to replant if
    necessary. There is little gain in rushing the season
    too much, however, for the tomato is not only
    sensitive to frost but it does not thrive under what <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> people call &quot;raw, mean, chilly weather.&quot; Such
    conditions may also be responsible for misshapen
    fruits. A grower for local market not infrequently
    risks a share of his plants before safe setting time
    in the hope that warm weather may give the crop
    a good start toward early ripe fruit to sell at high
    prices.</p>
<p>Delayed planting and use of plants that do not
    start quickly into vigorous growth is the cause of
    heavy losses in the north, especially among cannery
    growers. Better quality and heavier yields
    are attained if the bulk of the crop matures before
    cool weather in the fall. In the south, it is necessary
    to get good plant development and a full set
    of fruit before hot weather which often destroys
    the blossoms.</p>
<h3>Plant Protectors</h3>
<p>Many forms of plant protectors are on the
    market&mdash;of paper and of other materials. These
    act as little greenhouses for the individual plant,
    protecting against frost and promoting growth.
    Plants may be set out-of-doors a couple of weeks
    earlier by their use. The most common forms are
    of translucent paper reinforced by pasted strips of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> paper or by wire. The trick is to devise one that
    is cheap, that will admit maximum light and that
    will withstand the weather. For tomatoes, they
    need to be tall, which makes the problem of wind
    resistance more serious.</p>
<p>For emergencies, opaque cover, baskets upside
    down or even newspaper may be used. Many a
    field has been saved by burying the plants when
    frost threatened, carefully uncovering when danger
    is past.</p>
<h3>Spacing</h3>
<p>Untrained tomatoes are set at distances from
    3&frac12; feet each way to 7 &times; 7 feet or even more. The
    extreme width is found on rich irrigated lands in
    California where plants make tremendous growth.
    The closer spacings are found on lighter soils
    where humus, plant food, and moisture are not
    too abundant. The variety should also be considered.
    Sixteen square feet per plant is about average.</p>
<p>Check row planting is common, though it is not
    feasible where transplanters are used. Wider spacing
    between the rows than between plants is desirable
    as it permits later cultivation one way and
    leaves a better passage for pickers with less damage <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> to plants and fruits. Thus, 3&frac12; &times; 4&frac12; feet
    might be preferred to 4 &times; 4 feet.</p>
<p>Rows for single stem, staked and pruned plants
    may be as close as three feet and plants may be
    as close as eighteen or even twelve inches, though
    some growers contend that two feet is close
    enough.</p>
<h3>Methods of Planting</h3>
<p>The essential point in field setting is to pack
    the soil firmly about the roots, thus establishing
    maximum contact for moisture absorption. Whatever
    the method of planting, the aim should be to
    get the plants from the old home to the new with
    as little delay and check in growth as possible. For
    the first-early crop, they should be moved so that
    &quot;they never know it.&quot; With bands, pots or blocking
    in flats or beds, it is feasible to avoid practically
    all disturbance of roots.</p>
<p>The tomato will, under ordinary favorable conditions,
    take hold and grow even if shaken quite
    free of earth. Plants, however, should be dug
    loose rather than pulled, to prevent undue breakage
    of roots.</p>
<p>Plants ought to be watered well some hours before
    transplanting. Transplanting machines and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> hand planters of the Masters type give a little shot
    of water at the root, thus helping to establish contact
    with the soil. Starter solutions are discussed
    on page 35. These machines are commonly used
    for cannery setting and, to some extent, for market
    tomatoes. Blocked plants can be set pretty fast by
    hand with much less disturbance of roots. Some
    manage to set potted or blocked plants by machine,
    keeping a ball of earth about the roots.</p>
<p>The rows are usually marked out fairly deeply,
    plants are dropped in fours between rows and it is
    a very short job to pack soil about the clod of
    earth in which the plant is growing. Another
    method is for one worker to make an opening with
    a spade. A second places the plant in the wedge-like
    opening and the first steps on the soil to firm
    it solidly about the roots.</p>
<p>Plants are generally set a little deeper than in
    the plant bed.</p>
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
<p>The old idea about cultivation was &quot;the more,
    the better.&quot; More recent experiments notably
    those by Thompson have shown that little need
    be done beyond controlling weeds. He found that
    stirring the soil gave no significant increase in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> yield over mere scraping sufficient to destroy
    weeds. It is pretty hard to convince many old time
    gardeners of this. The value of dust mulch for
    conservation of moisture has been pretty well discredited
    by experimental comparisons.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>Irrigation is not essential for tomato production
    in humid climates and is seldom provided except
    under market garden conditions. Water is occasionally
    an asset in a dry season and, of course, the
    grower who waters at such times reaps a harvest
    in higher prices as well as in increased yield. The
    advantage of irrigation is especially marked if dry
    weather retards plant growth and delays maturity
    of the first of the crop, for the high prices of the
    early market are involved. Judicious irrigation
    will sometimes continue production for late fall
    market. Yet gardeners seldom plan permanent
    overhead equipment for tomatoes. The movable
    lines that are now used to a considerable extent
    serve well for the tomato crop.</p>
<p>The furrow method of irrigating tomatoes is the
    most common in the West. This plan allows the
    water to make its way down the rows, slowly soaking <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> in all along the line. The tomato stands
    drouth better than many of our crops, especially
    if the soil holds moisture fairly well, either naturally
    or through a liberal humus content. Excessive
    moisture is doubtless a factor in causing the
    plants to run to vine and drop their blossoms.
    Hence, in western sections, it is customary to water
    thoroughly just before or just after setting the
    plants and then to avoid applications until the setting
    of fruit is well advanced.</p>
<p>Thorough soaking is better than frequent light
    waterings, as it encourages a better development
    of root system. An Idaho bulletin suggests three
    irrigations. Late irrigations tend to delay ripening
    of fruit, but this object is sought in the late
    fall shipping districts of California which find
    their best markets after eastern crops have been
    nipped by frost.</p>
<p>Irrigation must be handled with care to avoid
    cracking of fruit, which occurs when soil becomes
    rather dry and then is heavily watered. Watering
    late in the season is said to make fruit watery and
    of poor quality.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<h3>Mulching</h3>
<p>R. A. Emerson<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in 1903 reported results of
    careful comparisons between vegetables that were
    cultivated and others that were mulched with
    straw. These results indicate that mulching gives
    good results with tomatoes, both as to yield and
    quality. However, frost injury was more severe on
    mulched plats, and Emerson points out that the
    mulch should not be applied until the plants are
    well established.</p>
<p>Mulching is recommended by a good many
    writers and growers and it seems to be practiced
    to some extent in Missouri. The advantages
    claimed are conservation of moisture and clean,
    fine quality fruit. L. W. Purdum and Sons of
    Virginia use 4-5 tons per acre of wheat straw, staking
    their plants and irrigating. They report unusually
    heavy returns per acre under these methods.
    The Missouri people apply as much as sixteen
    tons per acre, making the cover five or six inches
    thick. The practice of mulching, however, is not
    common, and the cost will likely prevent its general
    use.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h2>TO TRAIN THEM UP OR LET<br />
    THEM SPREAD</h2>
<p>Growers attending conventions will often stay
    up half the night to argue about training and
    pruning tomatoes and to debate the details of their
    favorite procedures.</p>
<p>For home garden, the method is strongly commended.
    Many market gardeners follow the practice
    and it has gained materially of recent years in
    New England. Some market reports quote staked
    tomatoes separately and at a materially higher
    level than fruit from unpruned plants.</p>
<p>Most of the southern shipping sections follow
    the practice and it is practically universal in greenhouses.</p>
<p>One way is to drive a stake by each plant tying
    at several points along the stem with cheap twine.
    The other plan, recently gaining in favor, is to set
    posts every 25 feet or so, string a heavy wire on
    top, and another a foot from the ground. Cheap
    jute twine is strung between wires and the tomato
    plants are merely twisted around the string. Tying <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> is not required. Some omit the lower wire, tying
    a non-slipping bowline loop around the plant near
    the ground. In either case, plants are kept
    trimmed to a single stem though occasionally an
    extra branch is allowed to grow. In southern Illinois,
    plants are tied to a short stake <a name="i078" id="i078">without pruning</a>.</p>

    trained plants.</span> </div>
<h3>Pro and Con</h3>
<p>The advantages claimed for pruning and training
    are:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Earliness.<br />
        High yield per acre.<br />
        <span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>Ease of cultivating and spraying.<br />
        Ease of picking.<br />
        No injury from snails and wire worms.<br />
        Quality of fruit:&mdash;size, color, smoothness and cleanliness.<br />
        Crop finished earlier.<br />
        Less sunscald.<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The disadvantages claimed are:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Many plants required.<br />
        Reduced yield.<br />
        More blossom-end rot.<br />
        Higher cost of labor.<br />
        Cost and care of stakes and wire.<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The validity of each of these points varies
    greatly with conditions; in fact, the answer to the
    whole question depends largely upon the location
    and the ideas of the grower. In trying to reach a
    conclusion, it is well to realize that training makes
    certain radical changes in the plant. It loses leaves
    through pruning, it is supported from the ground,
    and it is spaced differently. Since the leaves manufacture
    the basic substance for themselves, and for
    the rest of the plant, removal of leaves reduces the
    resources of the plant. H. C. Thompson<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> found that the root system is reduced about in
    proportion to leaf reduction. It is fairly clear that
    single-stem training greatly reduces the yield per
    plant, and other methods result similarly in proportion
    to the severity of pruning. When plants
    are spaced closely enough together the yield may
    be brought up to that of areas unpruned and unstaked.
    Idaho experiments indicate that staking
    alone does not affect the total yield, but that it
    does favor early maturity under the different
    pruning systems. The disadvantages of training
    are largely economic. Will the marketing conditions
    justify the extra cost of staking and pruning?</p>
<p>Experiments have shown pretty clearly that sunscald,
    blossom-end rot and cracking are worse on
    trained plants. Using varieties of good foliage will
    help the first trouble while uniform and adequate
    water supply achieved by selection of suitable
    land, by building humus content of the soil and by
    irrigation will solve the latter two problems.
    Thompson found increased yield of early fruit.
    Other evidence is somewhat conflicting but, in
    general, it supports Thompson. It is generally
    agreed that pruned plants yield larger, cleaner and
    more perfectly formed and colored fruits. Ease of
    spraying or dusting and of picking is important.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>For pruned plants, 3&frac12; feet between rows and
    1&frac12;-2 feet between plants is about right.</p>
<p>To train or not to train is a question that one
    must answer for himself as the controlling factors
    vary too widely&mdash;costs of stakes, wire and labor,
    prices of early tomatoes and possibility of cultivating
    a more or less fancy trade.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h2>THE ETERNAL BATTLE WITH<br />
    INSECTS AND DISEASES</h2>
<p>The tomato, in most regions, is not one of our
    most &quot;pestered&quot; crops. Although over thirty diseases
    of tomatoes are discussed in books and bulletins,
    most of them are only occasionally serious or
    are subject to definite control methods. Enemies
    are generally worse in the warmer climates.</p>
<p>Most home garden tomatoes and many commercial
    crops are grown without benefit of spray
    or dust. If trouble arises, county agent or college
    specialist can usually advise, suggesting methods
    suitable for local conditions.</p>
<p>Experience must, of necessity, be the guide in
    shaping a program and costs must be carefully balanced
    against results.</p>
<p>The principal measures that are widely used are
    seed treatment against damping off, use of resistant
    strains against fusarium wilt and application
    of bordeaux mixture against leaf blights.</p>
<p>As with all plants, thoroughness must be the
    watchword in spraying or dusting. Timeliness, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> choice of weather conditions so far as possible, and
    covering all surface lightly rather than throwing
    on heavy blotches of spray or dust all require careful
    attention.</p>
<p><i>Fusarium Wilt</i> (Fusarium lycopersici) is perhaps
    the most serious of all the tomato diseases
    although it occasions little trouble in the more
    northerly states. It is troublesome as far north as
    New Jersey to Iowa.</p>
<p>The fungus winters in the soil, enters through
    the roots and blocks the water passages of the plant
    causing wilting, yellowing, and finally, death. Water
    vessels in the stem are discolored,&mdash;another
    means of identifying the disease.</p>
<p>Spraying or dusting are of no service since the
    fungus is within. Long time rotation and use of
    the many resistant strains are <a name="i085" id="i085">effective means of</a> control.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"> <img src="images/i085.jpg" width="700" height="427" alt="Figure 17.&mdash;Resistance to fusarium wilt. Row on left center is planted to an ordinary variety, row on
right with one of F. J. Pritchard's wilt-resistant selections. Insert shows plant attacked by wilt fungus." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 17.</span>&mdash;Resistance to fusarium wilt. Row on left center is planted to an ordinary variety, row on
    right with one of F. J. Pritchard&#39;s wilt-resistant selections. Insert shows plant attacked by wilt fungus.</span> </div>
<p><i>Leaf Spot</i>, <i>Septoria Blight</i> (Septoria lycopersici)
    causes heavy loss by destroying the foliage and so
    the fruit-making power of the plant. It also opens
    the fruits to sunscald. The spots appear as small
    dark water soaked areas which enlarge but little
    though they increase in number and turn brown.
    Tiny black dots, the fruiting bodies of the fungus,
    appear. The spores germinate only on moist leaves <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> and the disease is spread by wind, rain, workers
    and the like. It winters on refuse of the tomato
    and related plants.</p>
<p>Fall plowing helps to control. Bordeaux spraying
    beginning in the seed bed and carried faithfully
    through the season will usually hold the
    trouble in check.</p>
<p><i>Late Blight</i> (Phytophthora infestans) is the
    same fungus as the late blight of potatoes, affecting
    both foliage and fruit. It is often troublesome
    the first few weeks after plants are set out-of-doors.
    Clean soil in seed bed and bordeaux spraying are
    helpful.</p>
<p><i>Western Blight</i>, <i>Yellows</i>, <i>Curly Top</i>,&mdash;cause unknown,&mdash;is
    prevalent in California. Leaves roll
    and become thickened and brittle, later turning
    a sulfury yellow. Veins become purplish. The
    trouble prevails in hot weather. The cause is
    likely a virus, similar to or identical with the curly
    top of beets. It is apparently spread by leaf hoppers.
    No satisfactory control has been devised
    though there is some promise in <a name="i087" id="i087">resistant strains</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;"> <img src="images/i087.jpg" width="650" height="384" alt="Figure 18.&mdash;Diseases of the tomato. 1. Septoria or leaf spot. 2. Mosaic. 3. Mosaic, filiform." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 18.</span>&mdash;Diseases of the
    tomato. 1. Septoria or leaf spot. 2. Mosaic. 3. Mosaic, filiform.</span> </div>
<p><i>Mosaic.</i>&mdash;No organism has been definitely connected
    with the mosaic diseases of tomatoes, but
    they are highly infectious, being spread by means
    of what is called a &quot;virus,&quot; which passes the finest <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> filters. It is spread by insects, notably aphids,
    which carry plant juice, and in the handling of
    plants, but it does not persist in seeds or in litter.
    It is wintered on horse nettles and three species of
    ground cherries. Control suggestions include
    roguing affected plants, eliminating weeds, and
    controlling carrying insects. The symptoms are
    widely various, the most common being mottling
    of leaves, stunting and malformation of leaflets,
    which sometimes become fine ribbons or threads,
    curling, appearance of small brown dead areas,
    and spots and cracks on fruits.</p>
<p><i>Damping off</i> is caused by various fungi in the
    seed bed which attack the stem near the surface
    of the soil and cause the plant to drop over and
    die. Clean soil, heating of soil, commonly called
    sterilization, and care in watering are all helpful.
    It is now common practice to dust seed with formaldehyde
    dust, or with red copper oxid or with
    an organic mercury disinfectant. If trouble is
    serious, a watering with semesan just before seedlings
    emerge may be helpful.</p>
<p>A government bulletin on &quot;Market Diseases of
    Tomatoes&quot; (Miscellaneous Publication 121, 1932)
    is an excellent summary with colored plates to
    help in recognizing the various troubles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<h3>Insects</h3>
<p><i>The Fruit Worm</i> (Chloridea obsoleta) is probably
    the worst of the tomato insects, but is not
    prevalent in the North. It is the same as the corn
    ear-worm or the cotton boll-worm, and bores into
    green or ripening fruits. It winters in the soil
    and fall plowing is recommended for its control.
    Planting corn as a trap crop is also suggested.
    The Virginia Truck Experiment Station finds
    that the addition of two pounds of calcium arsenate
    to 50 gallons of the Bordeaux used for
    disease control helps materially.</p>
<p><i>Cut-worms</i> (various species of the family Noctuidae)
    cause severe losses at the time of field setting.
    They winter in the soil and are worse when
    sod has been plowed under, or following other
    host plants. Poison bran mash is commonly used
    to combat them, using a spoonful to each plant.
    Hand picking and the use of paper collars are
    resorted to on a small scale. Well-hardened plants
    seem less subject to injury by these pests than tender
    plants.</p>
<p><i>Colorado Potato Beetle</i> (Leptinotarsa decemlineata)
    can cause a world of damage to young
    plants. Arsenical spray or dust will ordinarily <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> control them. The old-fashioned potato bug (family
    Meloidae), is reported as troublesome in Missouri.
    When they appear in droves, the only
    control is to drive them with brush. Arsenical
    spray or dust is of some value.</p>
<p><i>Flea Beetles</i> (family Chrysomelidae) are the little
    black jumping fellows that perforate leaves in
    plant beds and in the field. They are also accused
    of injuring blossoms and reducing the set of fruit.
    Their attacks upon young plants are sometimes
    ruinous. Bordeaux with arsenical serves as a repellant.
    Dusting with nicotine sulphate dust is
    also suggested.</p>
<p><i>Green Tomato Worms</i>, or <i>Horn Worms</i> (Phlegethontius
    sexta) are big, green fellows and have
    a great capacity for tomato foliage. Hand-picking
    and arsenical spray or dust are usual means of
    combat.</p>
<p><i>The stalk-borer</i> (Papaipema nitela) is a slender
    caterpillar which is reported as serious in Indiana.
    No satisfactory control is suggested except clean
    culture around fields and pinching the stems to
    destroy the pest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VIII</h2>
<h2>SKILLFUL SELLING CROWNS<br />
    THE ENTERPRISE</h2>
<p>The most skillful production is in vain if marketing
    is not done well. At the same time, the
    quality of the goods is the principal factor in making
    the price and in moving the goods. Even then,
    if costs in production and marketing are too high,
    the enterprise is a failure.</p>
<p>The differences between high and low quotations
    on the same market the same day, are usually
    fairly wide,&mdash;say, $1.75 to $2.50; or $0.75 to $1.25;
    or $0.20 to $0.25 per basket. These differences
    are sufficient to make the difference between profit
    and loss. Small differences in quality of the product,
    in handling and dress-up of the market pack
    and skill in finding buyers may easily result in
    price differences as great or greater than those
    indicated.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>Picking in the field calls for the closest care and
    supervision to prevent damage to the fruits and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> vines. Stems should be removed to avoid punching
    other fruits, and long finger-nails do great
    harm by cutting the skin and admitting infection.
    Containers should not be too large to be handled
    conveniently. Round half-bushel stave baskets
    and galvanized pails are excellent. Baskets made
    of quarter-inch staves rather than veneer are
    smooth and durable, but the investment is rather
    heavy unless dumping is resorted to. In practice,
    all sorts of boxes and crates are used, often the
    package that is used for marketing. No container
    as deep as a bushel basket should be used.</p>
<p>The stage of ripeness at which tomatoes are
    picked depends upon the time and distance to
    market. For home use or local market, fruit may
    range from the first turn to almost fully colored.</p>
<p>A few growers pick at the turn and use ripening
    rooms to prepare for local selling. In this way
    cracking, injury by soil, by insects, and by uneven
    coloring are avoided. Fruits are wiped and
    handled with less loss and may even be washed
    if need be.</p>
<p>Fully ripened fruit will not stand handling and
    hauling and will quickly deteriorate, reaching the
    consumer in bad condition.</p>
<p>For cannery, full ripening is desired with even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> coloring. MacGillivray<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> has shown that success
    in this is largely a matter of care in picking. Cracking
    and slight softening are not serious defects for
    this purpose, but molds and bacteria in broken
    places are serious as they throw the product out of
    grade or occasion rejection.</p>
<h3>Picking Green</h3>
<p>Most tomatoes for long distance shipment, are
    picked before color appears,&mdash;at the mature-green
    stage. One of the great difficulties is to judge this
    stage correctly; to train ordinary labor to pick by
    maturity and not by size. Immature-green tomatoes
    ripen slowly and do not achieve good appearance
    or table quality.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to describe the ear marks
    of a mature-green tomato. Most of those usually
    cited are of doubtful value&mdash;glossy surface, whitish
    cast of color and the dark ring at the stem scar.
    The jelly-like or mucilaginous material in the
    seed cells has sufficiently developed in a mature
    green tomato so that the fruit may be sliced without
    cutting seeds. Of course, the tomato is ruined <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> but the method can be used to check one's judgment
    based on the exterior. Also, one can learn
    by laying aside tomatoes judged mature-green and
    immature-green to ripen.</p>
<p>Some efforts have recently been made in Florida
    to pick tomatoes at the turn, that is, at the
    first show of color, a practice suggested by Sando<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> some years ago. This should provide fruits of
    uniform degree of maturity, that would be about
    ready to sell on arrival and it would eliminate the
    serious problem of immature-greens. It would
    require more frequent picking of fields and there
    could be no delay in packing. There would,
    doubtless, also be problems of temperature and
    ventilation in transit. Results of tests thus far
    have been rather encouraging.</p>
<h3>Ripening</h3>
<p>Green wrap tomatoes are received at terminal
    markets by produce houses that have special
    ripening rooms where temperature is kept at
    about 70&deg;, with high humidity to prevent wilting
    or shriveling. Ethylene gas is used by some to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> hasten ripening. It does not change the nature of
    the process, merely speeding it up. Some of these
    repackers have elaborate equipment for sorting
    and packing.</p>
<p>The tomatoes, on arrival, are shaken out of
    their paper wraps. Any that have ripened in
    transit are taken out and packed while the greens
    go into the ripening rooms. They may have to be
    sorted over two or three times as ripening progresses.</p>
<p>The ripening process in tomatoes has been
    rather thoroughly studied. Sando found that tomatoes
    ripen uniformly, regardless of size, at a
    certain age, dating from the setting of the fruit.
    This time, which, of course, varies according to
    weather conditions, was eight weeks when the
    studies were made. Ripening is accompanied by
    an increase in moisture, acids and sugars, with decrease
    of solids, nitrogen, starch, pentisans, crude
    fibre and ash. Sugars increase from about a quarter
    to about half of the dry weight. Chemical
    analysis did not show differences sufficient to account
    for the difference in quality between vine-ripened
    fruit and green fruit ripened in the
    laboratory. Lack of ventilation seems to be detrimental.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>It is commonly held that tomatoes chilled without
    freezing will not ripen satisfactorily afterward.
    This belief is discounted by results of Wright and
    associates and of Platenius who found little effect
    of low temperatures upon later ripening.</p>
<p>Wright<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and Platenius<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> have both found that
    tomatoes should not be stored at low temperatures,
    50&deg; to 60&deg; F. being best. Storage is not
    likely to be satisfactory for more than a month.</p>
<h3>Waxing</h3>
<p>Waxing of tomatoes by immersion in a dilute
    water emulsion of paraffine and carnauba waxes
    is being tried out with very promising results.
    Waxes are also dissolved in volatile hydrocarbons
    and sprayed on. Moisture loss and shriveling are
    materially retarded, and interference with the
    ripening process is negligible. The wax coating is
    very thin, adds an attractive gloss and is <a name="i097" id="i097">entirely
    harmless</a>.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>It is generally true that at market the poorest
    products in a given lot tend to fix the price. When
    the buyer finds a few inferior specimens he assumes
    there are many more. Imperfect and diseased
    specimens infect others. Grading enhances
    the appearance <a name="i099" id="i099">of the pack</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the grower who picks marketable
    tomatoes and leaves unmarketable fruits on the
    vine is engaged in a form of grading&mdash;informal
    and subconscious. Methods may range from this
    simple practice to the elaborate schemes adopted
    in large packing houses. There is no difficulty in
    adopting methods for the farm that are easily managed
    and perfectly practical. In general, two
    grades to sell represent a good plan, leaving culls
    at home unless prices are high and there is good
    demand for them. The set-up may involve no
    more than a worker at a table with three baskets&mdash;one
    with tomatoes from the field; another for #1's
    and a third for #2's. The worker may well use a
    cotton flannel glove or cloth to wipe the tomatoes
    and the fruits should be placed in layers to bring
    the package to a good face. With some practice,
    this slows the operation but very little. Shed packing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> should be more common than it is though the
    practice seems to be gaining.</p>
<p>Shippers scattered from Cuba and California
    to New York state have packing houses set up to
    all degrees of elaborateness. Some have machines
    and conveyors that wash, sort for size, provide for
    hand sorting for grade and deliver to bins for
    packing. Experienced packers advance with the
    season from Florida to Lake Erie. These workers
    become almost incredibly expert and speedy. It
    is not uncommon for a worker to pick up, wrap
    and place in the lug box 60 or 70 tomatoes per
    minute&mdash;not as a show-off but in course <a name="fig21" id="fig21">of regular
    work</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>The federal government has worked out and
    published standards for the grades of tomatoes
    along with most other vegetables. These standards
    are practical and have found wide acceptance
    as furnishing common language between seller
    and buyer, especially for long distance shipment.
    The one who grades may, however, set up a standard
    of his own to meet the needs of his conditions
    and market.</p>
<p>U.S. Standards for cannery tomatoes are widely
    used as a basis of payment to the grower and this
    practice is to be commended.</p>
<h3>Packaging</h3>
<p>The lug box has almost wholly replaced the
    older 6-basket carrier and 4-basket flat for shipment
    of tomatoes. It is in almost every respect, a
    good package for tomatoes. It is built with solid
    board ends, with veneer or sawed sides, bottom
    and cover. Cleats on the ends serve to raise the
    lids so that a bulge pack will not be injured by
    pressure. Veneer covers and bottoms are held together
    by stitched veneer cross pieces. The lug
    box is packed in three layers and holds about 30
    pounds net of tomatoes though it is often over-packed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> to carry considerably more. The bulge
    pack is desirable only so far as it is necessary to
    insure a tight pack and to take up the small
    shrinkage that takes place in transit. Ordinarily,
    it goes beyond this. It results in delivery of more
    tomatoes than are paid for, and in bruising because
    the top <a name="fig22" id="fig22">center is too high</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/i102.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="Courtesy Southern Arkansas Growers Association&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 22.&mdash;The lug box is the most widely used of all tomato
packages. This is well packed and labeled but shows too much

    <p><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 22.</span>&mdash;The lug box is the most widely used of all tomato
        packages. This is well packed and labeled but shows too much

</div>
<p>The late M. R. Ensign in Florida, was working
    with a wire-bound lug to carry 20 pounds of
    tomatoes in two layers without bulge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>The lug box is packed in three layers and the
    size of fruits is designated by the number of tomatoes
    each way,&mdash;6 x 6, 6 x 7, and 7 x 7 being
    the commonest sizes. Each tomato is wrapped in
    a square of tissue paper which may or may not
    be printed. The principal advantage of the paper
    is to cushion the pack and protect the tomatoes
    against rubbing and abrasion. Where tomatoes
    are small, U.S. Standards provide for &quot;bridge
    pack&quot; or partial extra layers, for extra rows and
    for double wraps or two tomatoes <a name="fig23" id="fig23">in one paper.</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"> <img src="images/i103.jpg" width="700" height="427" alt="Figure 23.&mdash;Lug boxes as loaded in car." title="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 23.</span>&mdash;Lug boxes as loaded

<p>Lug boxes were formerly loaded lengthwise of
    the car but are now generally loaded crosswise,&mdash;that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> is, the side of the box is crosswise throwing
    the heavy endwise thrust against the substantial
    end of the box. Thin strips are nailed between
    layers, butting against the sides of the car to prevent
    shifting of the load and closing of ventilation
    channels. Refrigerated cars are generally used <a name="fig24" id="fig24">but
    icing is not usual</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"> <img src="images/i104.jpg" width="700" height="548" alt="Figure 24.&mdash;The square braid basket is widely used as a local market

    as a local market package for tomatoes. The faced pack looks better and is

<p>A few shipping sections, notably New Jersey,
    still use the 12-quart climax basket for tomatoes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>Local markets use various containers for tomatoes,&mdash;the
    Boston bushel box; a half bushel of the
    same depth also used in New England; lug boxes;
    the Jersey tomato crate; and very commonly, 8
    and 12-quart square braid veneer market baskets.
    Peach baskets and bushel baskets are now used
    but little, being too deep for good carrying. The
    diamond market basket of earlier years has about
    disappeared&mdash;being too flexible and not suited for
    stacking. The square braid with suitable cover
    may be stacked very satisfactorily in trucks but
    is hardly substantial <a name="fig25" id="fig25">enough for rail shipment</a>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"> <img src="images/i105.jpg" width="700" height="403" alt="Figure 25.&mdash;The Connecticut half bushel box. Figure 19

<p>Hot house tomatoes travel in square braid,
    climax or paper fibre baskets, now rather commonly, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> the latter. The Cleveland section sells
    some millions of baskets of 8-quart capacity but
    carrying 8 pounds of tomatoes in two layers, usually
    with stems on, usually wrapped and sometimes
    with a paper divider<a name="fig26" id="fig26"> between layers.</a></p>

<p>Cannery tomatoes move in field crates belonging
    to the canner or, in Jersey, in 5/8 bushel baskets,
    about as awkward a container as could be
    readily devised unless it should be the Jersey <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> tomato crate with its two cover strips permanently
    fastened.</p>
<p>Repack tomatoes are sometimes replaced in lugs
    or in half lugs. Ten pound corrugated cartons
    are widely used, newer and fancier packs being
    but one layer deep. Fruits are wrapped with
    paper or cellulose film. An increasing proportion
    of repacks are now put up in one-pound cartons
    with a window of cellulose film, carrying four or
    five tomatoes. A variation is a paper tray wrapped
    with cellulose film.</p>
<p>Good marketing calls for a good label for whatever
    package is used. These are usually pasted on
    the package. Paper containers are often printed
    directly but the problem of misuse of second hand
    packages is coming to the fore.</p>
<h3>Selling</h3>
<p>Success in selling demands in the producer the
    qualities which we ordinarily expect in the business
    man. The good grower is a business man if
    he succeeds, and this will be more true in the
    future than in the past, as competition increases.
    It is necessary to judge the men one deals with,
    forming estimates as to reliability and character. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> Mutual confidence is essential to satisfactory dealings.
    It is worth while to study the produce business
    and to learn its ins and outs, reading a trade
    paper, talking with dealers, and making trips to
    markets.</p>
<p>Shipments are made on &quot;f.o.b.&quot; or track sale,
    on consignment, or on joint account. The first
    plan of outright sale is the most desirable and is
    possible where there is enough business at a given
    point to attract buyers or where grades and business
    standing are well enough established to assure
    the purchaser of what he is getting. When
    the quality of the product is uncertain or when
    markets are glutted, consignment must be resorted
    to. Under this plan, the shipper owns the
    goods until the receiver makes a sale and all the
    risks up to this point are his. There are many
    consignment houses of high character if the shipper
    will take the trouble to find them instead of
    shipping to any one who writes a good letter, and
    there is vigorous competition in the trade. These
    factors make it possible to secure fairly good service
    most of the time. Joint account selling,
    where shipper and receiver agree on how returns
    shall be divided, is sometimes undertaken where
    mutual acquaintance justifies it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>Selling on distant markets is more complex and
    difficult than local selling for many reasons. Shoving
    crates off the wagon into the car and forgetting
    them is not selling. Co-operative organization has
    helped many communities through pooling of resources,
    standardizing, grading and packing the
    product, encouraging better field practices, and
    securing the services of able managers and salesmen.</p>
<h3>Local Selling</h3>
<p>A very small amount of produce is sold by producers
    directly to the consumer at his home, but
    the roadside market has greatly developed retail
    activity by growers. Here fine quality, attractive
    appearance, moderate prices, and fair dealing are
    effective in building business. Stands that plan to
    &quot;fleece them as they pass&quot; do not last long. It is
    the return business that counts. The bulk of local
    selling is done directly to retailers&mdash;grocers or
    hucksters&mdash;either at market or store-door. The
    costliness of this system is being realized and local
    commission business is growing, in many cases
    through the establishment of commission houses
    co-operatively owned and managed by growers, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> as in Providence, Cleveland, Chicago and other
    markets.</p>
<p>Some effort has been made to increase the use
    of tomatoes as has been successfully done with
    oranges and bananas. These efforts have been
    sporadic and results have been hardly more consistent
    than the efforts. Co-operative publicity,
    especially at times when large quantities are to be
    moved, would seem to offer fine possibilities.
    Growers of some crops are finding chain store
    groups very ready to help in moving out large
    volumes of produce when the supply is large.</p>
<h3>Cannery Selling</h3>
<p>Cannery sales are generally made at a stipulated
    price on contracts closed in advance of planting.
    These contracts have usually devoted more words
    to protecting the interests of the packer than those
    of the grower, largely because the grower has accepted
    the canner's initiative with little question.
    Farseeing companies have been fair in enforcement
    of terms and liberal in their dealings, realizing
    that prosperity must be mutual for the
    highest success. A few canners have contract provisions
    that enable the grower to share in prices <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> realized for the packed product when they rise
    beyond a certain figure. Too many canners have
    lacked vision, however, and have taken all they
    could get. Farmers have known little about costs
    and so have frequently been lured by the prospect
    of cash return even though they see no money
    until the packed tomatoes are actually sold. During
    recent years, much has been learned about
    the business side of growing for cannery purposes
    and the knowledge has been made available
    through extension channels. Growers have shown
    some tendency to organize and some canners welcome
    this movement as helping them to set their
    affairs on a plane of definite understanding. Canners
    have suffered sadly through failure of growers
    to live up to contracts if it suited them better to
    evade the terms, and organization helps greatly
    to develop the producer's sense of responsibility.
    Indiana has formed a federation of locals, but an
    organization movement in another state failed,
    more because the directors and members did not
    live up to their duties than through opposition of
    certain hostile canners. Co-operation in this field
    has the same possibilities, requirements and dangers
    as in other fields. With time and experience, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> co-operation will be an increasing and beneficial
    factor in the business.</p>
<p>In some sections, most of the cannery tomatoes
    are sold on open market, and in others, the early
    part of the crop is free for local sale or shipment.
    This arrangement would seem to have possibilities
    for further development by the use of good
    plants and good culture.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>IX</h2>
<h2>OPERATING IN THE RED OR IN<br />
    THE BLACK</h2>
<p>Happily, the home gardener does not need to
    keep books with his tomatoes. If he likes the
    culture and the product, he need not inquire
    further.</p>
<p>Not so with the commercial grower. After all
    skill has been exercised in growing and selling,
    the books must show black and not red. This calls
    for good management and judgment not only as
    to what is best for the tomatoes and for the consumer
    but also how much one can afford to spend
    to gain a given advantage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, quality, yield and economy generally
    go hand in hand. One of the best ways to
    achieve low unit cost is to win a high yield per
    acre.</p>
<p>For the cannery crop, conditions are sometimes
    such that one cannot afford to apply, say, optimum
    fertilizer because some other factor not
    readily controlled may limit the returns and so
    make heavy feeding uneconomical.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Yield.</i>&mdash;The average yield per acre of cannery
    tomatoes for the United States was, in 1940, 5.39
    tons per acre and the 10-year average, to 1938,
    was 4.15 tons per acre. For tomatoes for fresh
    market, the average yield for 1940 was 148 bushels
    per acre, 14 bushels above the 10-year average.
    Of course, these yields would not satisfy a grower
    who calls himself successful. In the canning sections
    of New York, it takes about 7 tons per acre
    to cover costs of production. Some years ago a
    survey in Arkansas recorded costs as low as $36
    per acre. However, the same survey showed cost
    per ton as $13.64. Cannery contracts that year
    averaged about $12.75 per ton. That does not
    yield much money to bank even if ten or twenty
    acres are grown. Rarely yields run to 25 tons per
    acre.</p>
<p>It is accordingly necessary to keep costs down
    and to bring yields up. Each item of cost must be
    scrutinized and adjusted to bring lowest cost per
    ton or per package.</p>
<p>In counting costs, it is necessary to include
    every element. The following summary from 118
    Western New York farms for 1934 for cannery
    tomatoes illustrates the various items:</p>

<p>All too often, growers think they are counting
    costs when such important items as interest, use of
    truck and machinery or others are omitted. One
    sometimes sees such figures in print.</p>
<p>One good way to view returns is in terms of
    cents per hour for labor. Cost accounts in New
    York have showed that a group of farmers who
    raised cannery tomatoes the nine years up to 1937
    and whose records were studied, realized $0.34
    per hour for their time given to tomatoes, $0.51
    for potatoes, $0.24 for wheat, and $0.11 for oats.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
